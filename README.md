# W3-JS-PWGEN
The Week 3 Challenge had us doing Javescript with HTML and CSS provided. 
JS code once completed allowed for a "Generate password" option with some optional extras for the selection criteria.
Was a good challenge with a lot of further research to complete in order to be able to finish the task.
